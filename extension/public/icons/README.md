# Extension Icons

Place your extension icons here:
- icon16.png (16x16px)
- icon48.png (48x48px)
- icon128.png (128x128px)

## Requirements

- PNG format
- Transparent background recommended
- Simple, recognizable design
- Should work in both light and dark themes

## Placeholder

For development, you can use any 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG images.
The extension will work without icons, but Chrome Web Store requires them for submission.
